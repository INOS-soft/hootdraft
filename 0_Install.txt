Thank you for downloading PHP Draft! PHP Draft allows commissioners to setup web-based real-time drafts for their fantasy sports leagues. If your leagues do "offline" drafts (instead of using your fantasy provider's online drafting tools), PHP Draft is just for you! You log in to PHP Draft, add managers, determine the number of rounds, style of draft (standard or serpentine), the sport and the name, and then when you're ready to begin drafting. Your managers will come to you once they make a selection, and you enter it. As you enter picks, your managers will see real-time the picks being made, in a large, easy-to-read color-coded draft board.

REQUIREMENTS for PHP Draft:
-Web server with sufficient bandwidth
-PHP 5 installed
-MySQL and the ability to add a new database
-PHPMyAdmin or some other MySQL utility that allows import of large SQL dump files

To install, follow these steps.

1) Upload the entire PHP Draft project to a web server (will most likely be easiest through FTP).

2) In PHPmyAdmin, create a database called phpdraft (you can rename later). Click on that new database name on the left, and then click the Import tab. Click Browse, and select the newest SQL dump file from /sql_dumps. Click Go.

3) Open dbconn.php in your favorite IDE or text editor (I use Netbeans PHP).  Change $username and $password (lines 13 and 14) to your MySQL username and password. If you changed your database name from the default ("phpdraft"), make sure you change it a few lines down in the "select_db()" function call on line 20. Save and upload to web server.

4) If no errors in PHPmyAdmin, goto the base directory of your PHP Draft install: http://www.yoursite.com/

5) To login as PHPDraft admin, use these default credentials:
Username: admin_commish
Password: password

6) Once logged in, be sure to change the default administrator by going to the Control Panel tab, and click "Update Your User Profile" under the "User Management" section. From there you can change the password.

7) Enjoy! Any bugs, feature requests, comments or questions please send them to me at http://sourceforge.net/projects/phpdraft/
