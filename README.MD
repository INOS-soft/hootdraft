<b>Drag and drop depth charts for each team helps managers answer <em>"What does my team need?"</em> in a pinch!</b>

<b>Every league has "that one" manager who spends way too much time choosing a kicker (<em>come on, Kevin!</em>) Keep it fair with customizable pick timers!</b>

<b>Managers can wheel and deal their picks and their unselected future picks at any point while the draft is still ongoing!</b>
